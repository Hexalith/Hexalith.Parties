# Hexalith.Parties Test Framework

Hexalith.Parties uses a .NET 10, xUnit v3, Shouldly, NSubstitute, bUnit, Testcontainers, and Aspire-hosted integration test framework. The framework is already organized by production package boundary; keep that shape when adding coverage.

## Test Lanes

| Lane | Projects | Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 unit and component | `Hexalith.Parties.Contracts.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.Authentication.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.Client.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.Server.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.Projections.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.Security.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.AdminPortal.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.ConsumerPortal.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.UI.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.Picker.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.Mcp.Tests` | Pure domain behavior, contract shape, bUnit components, client/package boundaries, projection handler logic, and architectural fitness checks that do not require a live topology. |
| Tier 2 service integration | `Hexalith.Parties.Tests`, `Hexalith.Parties.Sample.Tests` | WebApplicationFactory flows, gateway routing, Dapr client substitutions, event subscriber behavior, and cross-component wiring that can run without a full external environment. |
| Tier 3 topology integration | `Hexalith.Parties.IntegrationTests` | Aspire/Dapr topology, sidecar health, gateway E2E behavior, and tests that depend on Docker, Dapr, or full orchestration. |
| Deployment validation | `Hexalith.Parties.DeployValidation.Tests` | Static deploy-time checks for Dapr components, access-control YAML, secret hygiene, and AppHost topology assumptions. |

## Running Tests

Run the focused lane first, then broaden only when the changed surface justifies it.

```powershell
# Fastest useful feedback for most source changes
.\scripts\test.ps1 -Lane unit

# Service wiring and WebApplicationFactory coverage
.\scripts\test.ps1 -Lane integration

# Dapr/Aspire topology validation
.\scripts\test.ps1 -Lane topology

# Static deployment guardrails
.\scripts\test.ps1 -Lane deploy

# Full solution test run
.\scripts\test.ps1 -Lane all

# Coverage collection through coverlet collector
.\scripts\test.ps1 -Lane coverage
```

Direct `dotnet test` must target an individual test project:

```powershell
dotnet test .\tests\Hexalith.Parties.Server.Tests\Hexalith.Parties.Server.Tests.csproj --configuration Release
dotnet test .\tests\Hexalith.Parties.IntegrationTests\Hexalith.Parties.IntegrationTests.csproj --configuration Release
```

xUnit v3 runs under Microsoft.Testing.Platform here. For focused filters, build the target project and invoke its test executable directly with single-dash arguments such as `-class Fully.Qualified.TestClass` or `-method Fully.Qualified.TestClass.TestMethod`.

## Architecture

Keep tests aligned with production ownership:

- Contracts tests protect stable command, event, value-object, and serialization shapes.
- Server tests cover aggregate `Handle` and `PartyState.Apply` behavior without Dapr or Aspire.
- Projection tests cover tenant isolation, event ordering assumptions, and fail-closed read-side behavior.
- Security tests cover GDPR, erasure, key-management, and audit paths without leaking personal data.
- AdminPortal and Picker tests use bUnit and existing test doubles.
- Integration and deploy-validation tests cover Dapr, Aspire, pub/sub, access-control components, and gateway behavior.

Reusable test data and helpers belong in `src/Hexalith.Parties.Testing` when they are shared across assemblies. Prefer pure helper methods first, then framework fixtures only when setup or cleanup has real lifecycle needs.

## Fixture And Data Rules

- Use `PartyTestData` or a nearby factory/helper instead of hardcoded repeated payloads.
- Prefer unique IDs for tests that can run in parallel; avoid shared mutable state.
- Keep assertions visible in the test body. Helpers may arrange or extract data, but should not hide the behavioral claim.
- New async tests should pass `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken` into touched async APIs when practical. The root xUnit1051 suppression covers existing debt, not new habits.
- When a test depends on Dapr/Aspire, place it in the integration or deploy-validation lane and document the environmental assumption in the test or fixture.

## Quality Gates

Every new test should be deterministic, isolated, explicit, focused, and fast:

- No sleeps or arbitrary timeouts when an observable state, response, or actor/topology status can be awaited.
- No broad cleanup of generated folders or shared state as part of unrelated tests.
- No personal data, tokens, command payloads, tenant secrets, or local absolute paths in logs, snapshots, or public evidence.
- No recursive submodule initialization in test setup. Root-level submodules are enough unless nested submodules are explicitly requested.
- Use Shouldly assertions and NSubstitute when doubles are needed.
